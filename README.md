## üìÇ Project Layout

- **[AIML Notes/](AIML Notes/)**  
  Reference PDFs, concept notes, and theoretical materials that complement the algorithms. Useful for understanding the logic and mathematics behind each model.

- **[Algorithms/](Algorithms/)**  
  Jupyter notebooks implementing common machine learning algorithms. Includes step-by-step explanations, code comments, and example datasets.  
  **Implemented algorithms include**:
  - Supervised Learning: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes.  
  - Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering.  
  - Association Rule Learning: Apriori Algorithm.  
  **Example notebook:** [Algorithms/KNN Algoritham.ipynb](Algorithms/KNN Algoritham.ipynb)

- **[DATASETS/](DATASETS/)**  
  Sample datasets used in notebooks. CSV files or other formats ready for experimentation.  
  Update file paths in notebooks if you move or rename datasets.

- **streamlit_app.py**  
  A Streamlit application showcasing some of the algorithms interactively. Users can input data and see predictions or visualizations in real time.

- **requirements.txt**  
  List of Python dependencies needed to run notebooks and Streamlit app. Includes packages like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `streamlit`.

- **metadata.json**  
  Contains project metadata, including algorithm details, dataset information, and any notes for automation or logging.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd ML_Algorithams
````

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### 2. Run Notebooks

1. Open Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Navigate to the **Algorithms/** folder.
3. Open any notebook, e.g., `KNN Algoritham.ipynb`.
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions to understand the implementation and results.

### 3. Run the Streamlit Demo

1. Launch the Streamlit app to test interactive demos:

   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
2. Interact with the UI to test ML algorithms with your own inputs.
3. Check visualizations, predictions, or performance metrics live.

## üìä Datasets

* All datasets are stored in **[DATASETS/](DATASETS/)**.
* Notebooks load CSVs from this folder by default.
* Large datasets should include a small README or description of the data format and columns.
* You can replace datasets with your own but ensure the column names match the notebook code.

---

## ‚ú® Contributing

* Add or improve notebooks in **Algorithms/**.
* Keep datasets organized in **DATASETS/**. Include descriptions for new or large datasets.
* Use clear code comments and document any additional package requirements in **requirements.txt**.
* Submit pull requests with a description of added content or fixes.

---

## üìö Notes & References

* This repository is intended for **educational purposes only**.
* For theory and problem statements, refer to **\[AIML Notes/]\(AIML Notes/)**.
* Notebooks are designed for clarity, learning, and experimentation, not for production deployment.
